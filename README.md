# CodeWars-Demo
Welcome to my CodeWars learning and practice repository! Here, I document my journey of skill enhancement as a programmer through regular engagement with CodeWars coding challenges.
## Repository Structure
- Each commit in this repository represents my initial attempt at solving a CodeWars coding problem before examining the community's solutions.
- Accompanied with the commit is the provided text for the coding problem.
- Most commits include a community solution which is different then my own.
- When I encounter challenges I can't crack, I include my work-in-progress, then carefully breakdown and study community solutions from CodeWars and then commit the hole process. These analyses are shared here.
## Learning Integration

I take learning seriously, and to maximize my growth, I've integrated several key practices:

- **Anki Flashcards:** I maintain an Anki flashcard deck where I capture the insights and lessons I gain from studying community solutions. This ensures spaced repetition learning and retention.

- **Valuable Lessons:** If I come across CodeWars problems that offer particularly valuable lessons and techniques, I include them in my Anki deck as well. This allows me to revisit and reinforce essential concepts for optimum learning.
Feel free to explore this repository and follow along with my programming journey. You can also check out my code-wars account [here](https://www.codewars.com/users/Fabiano.L). If you have any questions or suggestions, please don't hesitate to reach out. Happy coding! 🚀👨‍💻
