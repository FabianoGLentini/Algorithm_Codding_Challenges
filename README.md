# CodeWars & LeetCode Challenge Repository

Welcome to my coding challenge repository! Here, I document my journey of skill enhancement as a programmer through regular engagement with coding challenges on **CodeWars** and **LeetCode**.

## Repository Structure

* Each commit in this repository represents my initial attempt at solving a coding problem from **CodeWars** or **LeetCode** before reviewing community solutions.
* Commits include the provided text for the coding problem for reference.
* Most commits feature alternative community solutions which differ from my own.
* When encountering particularly challenging problems, I document my work-in-progress, thoroughly analyze community solutions, and share the complete learning process.

**Note:** Commits specify the platform (CodeWars or LeetCode) and the programming language used. If a commit message doesn't explicitly mention a language, assume itâ€™s JavaScript.

## Learning Integration

I take learning seriously and have integrated several key practices to maximize my growth:

* **Anki Flashcards:** I maintain an Anki flashcard deck to capture insights and lessons from community solutions, ensuring spaced repetition and retention.

* **Valuable Lessons:** Particularly valuable insights and techniques from challenges on both platforms are added to my Anki deck, allowing regular reinforcement of essential concepts.

Feel free to explore this repository and follow my programming journey. You can also visit my profiles:
